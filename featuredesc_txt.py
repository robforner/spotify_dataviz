feature_desc_txt = {'Danceability':'Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements        including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. The scale is ascending from least danceable to most danceable',
                    'Energy':' Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. The scale is ascending from least energetic to most energetic.',

                    'Loudness': 'Overall average loudness of a track, useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. The scale is ascending from least loud to most loud.',

                    'Speechiness':'''Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording the closer to 1.0 the attribute value is. 
                    Values > 0.66 = tracks made entirely of spoken words. Values > 0.33 and < 0.66 = tracks with both music and speech (rap). Values < 0.33 =  music and other non-speech-like tracks.''',

                    'Acousticness':'A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.',

                    'Instrumentalness':'Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.',

                    'Liveness':'Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.',

                    'Valence':'A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).',

                    'Tempo':'The overall estimated tempo of a track in a scale from 0 to 1.0. In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.'
